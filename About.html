    <p> Our Team's Story</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>The Northwest Missouri State Rugby team was founded in 2006 by students on campus who enjoyed the game of rugby, but had nowhere to play. The team was founded and has spent over a decade growing into the program that it is today. The students that make up the team are its backbone and the team has had positive growth every year.</dt>

        <dt>We practice on tuesdays and thursdays at the practice fields behind the hughs field house. </dt></dl>
